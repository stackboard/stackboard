  "body": "### Welcome to Stackboard.\r\nStackboard is an all in one drop in solution to onboard users quickly and easily onto your private cloud.\r\n\r\n### Enabling Self Service\r\nModern developers expect to be able to self service on their compute requirements to be able to effectively deliver on for their stakeholders.  In addition the devops movement, the proliferation of infrastructure as code and good API's have made this increasingly a reality.  However, most providers (including AWS, Openstack, and others) do not provide a good registration facility (for centrally managed accounts), expecting an admin to create users etc.  This leads to the proliferation of separate accounts with a lack of oversight, cost control, or operations best practices.\r\n\r\n### LDAP and AD \r\nMost companies have traditionally reached for a central authentication service like LDAP or Active Directory for this purpose, which typically provides bad incentives such as: \r\n1. The development of custom proxy services to authenticate infrastructure requests, breaking common software and patterns, requiring the redevelopment of any feature to use the proxy service.\r\n2. Complex integration, extending the delivery time of a standard solution for the company in question.  For example the authentication service typically resides in a secured part of the network, requiring routing, and firewall changes to services which are commonly used in production environments, necessitating rigorous change control and testing.\r\n3. Central authentication services increase risk with every new service that uses it, and it is common for the service to have been poorly architected, implemented, or has experienced bit rot over time.\r\n4. These services are embedded in mode 1 environments, and the mode 2 revolution needs an auth solution of its own.\r\n\r\n### What is Stackboard?\r\nStackboard is a Django app, which you install into your environment which allows your users to register for a service.  \r\n\r\nCurrently we support Openstack private clouds.  AWS account onboarding is scheduled for 2017.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor and founder: Max Cameron (@mcameron)\r\n\r\n### Open source software shoutout:\r\n@codeinthehole - https://github.com/codeinthehole/django-in-a-deb-file\r\n@openstack\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you would like support for your Stackboard implementation, please get in touch with support at stackboard dot co dot uk.",
